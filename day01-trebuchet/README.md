**What is the sum of all of the calibration values?**

1. In [Day 1 input](<../puzzle inputs/Day 1 Trebuchet/input.txt>)
2. On each line, the **calibration value** can be found by combining the
   **first digit** and the **last digit** (in that order) to form a
   single **two-digit number**.

```example
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
```

The **calibration values** of these four lines are `12`, `38`, `15`, and `77`.
Adding these together produces **142**.
